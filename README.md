# Amazon-Shipping-Analytics
Overview
Amazon Shipping is a company which ships a variety of FMCG (Fast Moving Consumer Goods) all over the world.

The Shipping Manager doesn't have much visibility and doesn't know how many orders are processed and shipped on a monthly basis. He would like a dashboard of this where he selects a month and can tell how many orders are outstanding a day and where they should be shipped.

He has given csv files from which I have created a Dashboard for his quick review so that he could take further decisions for the benefit of the company.

Thus, I created an interactive dashboard to showcase the metrics which can conveniently accessed. Now, he could switch and view different shipping stats for different months and years.
